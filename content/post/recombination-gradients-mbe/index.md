My second PhD paper about meiotic recombination in plants is now accessible as a preprint in [BioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.12.571209v1).

We found that recombination hostpots are ubiquitous in plant genic regions, mostly in promoters and terminators. As a consequence of this pattern, plant genic regions sequences experience recombination gradients along the coding sequence, and the middle of genes recombine less than the edge. You can find out more in the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.12.571209v1) awaiting for a good peer review.
