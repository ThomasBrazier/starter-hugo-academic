My new paper about meiotic recombination in plants is now published in PLOS Genetics <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010141>.

Meiotic recombination is a universal feature of sexually reproducing species. During meiosis, crossovers play a fundamental role for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis and reshuffles alleles among chromosomes. How much variation in recombination is expected within a genome and among different species remains a central question for understanding the evolution of recombination. We characterized and compared recombination landscapes in a large set of plant species with a wide range of genome size. We found that the number of crossovers varied little among species, from one mandatory to no more than five or six crossovers per chromosomes, whatever the genome size. However, we identified two main patterns of variation along chromosomes (with a few exceptions) that can be explained by a new conceptual model where chromosome length, chromosome structure and gene density play a role. The strong association between gene density and recombination was already known, but raised new questions not only about the evolution of recombination rates but also on their distribution along chromosomes.
