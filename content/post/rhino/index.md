I am proud of this new [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.24.620000) on the geometry of gametic dispersal in a flying mammal, *Rhinolophus hipposideros*. This study, supervised by [Eric Petit](https://www.umr-decod.fr/fr/personne/238), examines how different dispersal strategies influence gene flow in the lesser horseshoe bat, revealing both a high number of males mating in the colony they reside and extreme long-distance mating dispersal in a few males.
