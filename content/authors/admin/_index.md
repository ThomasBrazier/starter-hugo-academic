I have a background in bioinformatics and population genetics with a strong curiosity for computing science and data science (I regularly complete MOOCs on these topics). With an academic formation in modelling in ecology and evolution, I currently study evolution, genomics and population genetics.

I aim to develop and apply machine learning and deep learning skills to the field of population genomics in order to study the processes at the origin of genetic diversity in species and populations. Amongst these processes, my current academic research is focused on meiotic recombination with a genomic comparative approach. I am finishing my PhD with Sylvain Glémin (ECOBIO lab) at Rennes 1 University (France).
