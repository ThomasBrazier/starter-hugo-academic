With a background in population genetics, I'm fascinated by the many processes at the origins of genetic diversity. I have a special interest for those involved by the meiotic recombination in my most recent researches. Currently, I'm working on a PhD with Sylvain Glémin (ECOBIO lab) at Rennes 1 University (France) on the estimation of the local recombination rate along the genome for a large panel of Angiosperm species.
