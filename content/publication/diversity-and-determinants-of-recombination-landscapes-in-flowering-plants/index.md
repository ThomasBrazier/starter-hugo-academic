abstract: During meiosis, crossover rates are not randomly distributed along the
  chromosome and their location may have a strong impact on the functioning and
  evolution of the genome. To date, the broad diversity of recombination
  landscapes among plants has rarely been investigated and a formal comparative
  genomic approach is still needed to characterize and assess the determinants
  of recombination landscapes among species and chromosomes. We gathered genetic
  maps and genomes for 57 flowering plant species, corresponding to 665
  chromosomes, for which we estimated large-scale recombination landscapes. We
  found that the number of crossover per chromosome spans a limited range
  (between one to five/six) whatever the genome size, and that there is no
  single relationship across species between genetic map length and chromosome
  size. Instead, we found a general relationship between the relative size of
  chromosomes and recombination rate, while the absolute length constrains the
  basal recombination rate for each species. At the chromosome level, we
  identified two main patterns (with a few exceptions) and we proposed a
  conceptual model explaining the broad-scale distribution of crossovers where
  both telomeres and centromeres play a role. These patterns correspond globally
  to the underlying gene distribution, which affects how efficiently genes are
  shuffled at meiosis. These results raised new questions not only on the
  evolution of recombination rates but also on their distribution along
  chromosomes.
